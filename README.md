# Voice-Controlled-Home-automation-System 🎙️🏠⚙️

A basic voice controlled home automation system by interfacing python with Arduino UNO board.

# Problem Statements 📌 & Abstract 📝

  The aim of this project is to develop a voice-based home automation system using Arduino with Python using the Standard Firmata 
library. The system should allow users to control their home appliances and devices using voice commands, providing an intuitive and convenient way to interact with their home automation system. The system should be easy to use and reliable, allowing users to turn 
on/off lights, fans, ACs, and other home appliances using simple voice commands. The system should be designed to be scalable and 
flexible, allowing users to add or remove devices as per their requirements. The primary objective of this project is to develop a 
robust and efficient system that improves the user experience of home automation systems and simplifies the user's interactions with 
their home appliances.
